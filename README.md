# ABCU-CSV-Course-Information-Sorting-Application
A C++ program commissioned by ABCU University to sort course information stored in CSV files. 

1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

I was tasked with studying and utilizing several data structes including vectors, linked lists, hash maps, and binary search trees. 
I was to use these data structures to create programs that were capable of parsing csv files containing course data. 
The programs must have also been able to alphanumerically order and print the courses and search, add, and delete them as well. 

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by creating separate programs for each data type, testing each in its own environment.
Data structures are important to understand because each have their own uses which can be irreplaceable when truly needed, especially when storing large loads of data. 

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I used stack overflow to solve any of the problems I had. 

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

After learning about the different data structures and their uses, I now understand that simply using vectors and arrays is not enough to create a powerful program, as it will always be limited by linear searching.
Using the correct data structures when needed will greatly enhance future program runtime, makign the overall user experience much more enjoyable. 

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I have learned to use data structures and have learned a plethora of techniques to replace linear searching in data structures like vectors or arrays.
